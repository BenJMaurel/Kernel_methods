# Kernel_methods
Kernel methods for Machine Learning (MVA 2023).

You will find here my code for the Challenge "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-kernel-methods-2022-2023/leaderboard"

## Run the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenJMaurel/Kernel_methods.git
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python main.py
```

This will create a file y_pred.csv inside your repository that can be uploaded for the challenge. This is provided by a WL (or ShortestPath) kernel combined with a balanced SVM as described in the report.
